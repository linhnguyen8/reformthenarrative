                  But Why Should We?
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  First, petitions are a tactic. As explained by professor Dave Karpf at George Washington University, "online petitions are an early-stage political tactic that help build a broader campaign and serve a number of purposes: send a signal of public opinion to a decision maker, tell the media there is enough public attention to do a story, build a list of people who are interested in an issue, and raise money" Sending emails to legislators can have a similar effect because it put pressure on legislators, who have strong media presence, to advocate for change.
                  However, this is just the beginning. Signing petitions & sending emails alone will not promote change. Long term systematic change requires collaboration & continued support for a cause. We must research, educate ourselves, and relearn.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Is This Effective?
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  Yes! Through advocating, organizing, and speaking UP (protests, calls, petitions, emails, etc), we have gain justice for people. Still, the number of victims who gain justice are small compared to the number of victims who have NOT gain justice. We must use these examples as motivators, continue forward, and demand change!

                   It might be easy to just do a couple clicks to sign a petition or send an automatic email but make sure you read some of the stories of these victims of police brutality, racial violence, and sexual violence as well. We need to be reminded that these victims are humans, whose future is tarnished because of the color of their skin. Many of these victims were in their teenage years and got their life taken from them. This means like students like Tamir Rice, Kendrick Johnson, and Trayvon Martin were not able to graduate, know the feelings of starting a family, and follow their aspirations because their future was taken from them. Don’t let these victims be just a name on a hashtag. They are someone’s mother, father, son, daughter, niece, nephew. They could have been a student at your school. They could have been one of your friends. They are one of us. Let them rest in power but let us continue this fight for justice.

Three renown medical examiners have concluded it is "medically impossible" for Stacey Stites to have been killed at the time the state says she died. This alone exonerates Rodney Reed. Reed was convicted based on forensic expert testimony that has now been recanted by the scientists and agencies that offered the evidence. In fact, leading forensic pathologists have concluded that it would be "medically and scientifically impossible" for Reed to have murdered Stites.
