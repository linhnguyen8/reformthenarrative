                  "I do think antisemitism has been very normalized, which is kind of scary because I felt like I grew up in a way where if I saw something that was anti-semitic, I didn't even realize it was anti-semitic because I just thought it was normal. I think it's going to be really hard to change that. People have normalized antisemitism as being anti-Israeli or anti-Israeli government, and although these issues might overlap a little bit, the two groups aren't the same thing and it's really disheartening to see that people are normalizing antisemitism on that basis."

I do think that my high school is trying to be more inclusive over the past couple of years and trying to look at its programs, reforms, and policies through an equity lens."

                  "Because of the American Dream, families really neglect this idea of emotion-talking and confronting mental health issues, so it takes a second generation to have this conversation and begin destigmatizing the conversation about mental health and within the Asian American community at large. Thereâ€™s this mentality that it is family values versus mental health, but in reality, it goes hand in hand. It'll be an uphill battle, but I think it's a conversation that we need to have."

However, it really doesn't take into account the amount of diversity that there is in Colombia and in different parts of South America as well. These places include indigenous people, white Latinos, and a lot of Afro Colombians are in Colombia throughout the coast as well, but often we don't see that representation in the media."
