            <strong>Can you tell me a little bit about Seeds of Peace and how did you get involved in the first place?</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            I would say Seeds of Peace is a Leadership Camp founded on dialogue and bridging gaps, divisions, or spaces in which there is a conflict within our society, whether it be identity groups, social, economic statuses. Seeds of Peace brings different people together to bridge that gap through dialogue, so it is a dialogue founded conflict resolution camp.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            My first year of seeds of peace was 2018. I have a pretty unique story because I learned what Seeds of Peace was the Friday before the week I was supposed to leave for it because I had come back from a Border Links immersion trip with my school and everyone on the trip was asked the question of whether or not we would want to do an interview with MPR and share our experiences. Every single other person that went on the trip had something else to do, so since I didn’t I said hey why not and I filmed the interview. I thought it went well, and apparently it went really well because the next couple of weeks I was doing work study at my school and Tim Wilson came knocking on the door. I had no clue who he was at the time, so I couldn't open the door for him. He seemed to have known me, and I was thinking "stranger danger" the entire time. He was like "Oh my gosh, are you Danielle? Did you just go to Arizona for this Border Links trip?" And I said, "Yes, that is me! How do you know that?"
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            He then proceeded to share what Seeds of Peace was—this leadership dialogue camp that he thought I would love. I looked at him kind of sideways and I actually wrote down "Seeds of Peach" because that's what I thought he said. Then, the next day, I went home to show my parents and I got a call from our school's disciplinarian that said "You have to go! You don't understand how much of an opportunity this is, you must go!" So, that Friday, I scrambled to get everything in line, got my doctor stuff, packed my bags even though I had no idea where I was going. That Wednesday, I got on a bus and headed to Otisfield, Maine. That was my introduction to Seeds of Peace.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>
              For people who are unfamiliar with the PS program of Seeds of Peace, can you explain what the program was like?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            The PS stands for paradigm shifter, and it is essentially an advanced leadership program for Seeds of Peace second year campers. If you've already gone one year, you're eligible to apply to be a PS, and one of the major differences is that first year campers have dialogue once a day; meanwhile, PS campers have dialogues three times a day, so it leaves open a lot more time to really dive into any topic of your choosing. That's another key difference because in your first year you're  told what you're going to be talking about. They'll bring you into the dialogue, and they'll say "okay today we're gonna be talking about immigration." However, in the PS dialogue spaces, we always had that choice, so we were able to choose if we wanted to talk about police brutality or if we wanted to talk about something more economic like the wage gap. If we wanted to be silly and just talk about high school and what it means to be high schoolers, we could talk about that as well, so we really had a lot more choice. Within that choice, it was supposed to build our leadership skills in this idea of how we control our energy in the room, how we make space for other voices ,and we were really called to understand how power structures play into the room, time and time again. It was so interesting to see the dynamic between the white men in the room versus the black women in the room—how we interact with each other. We saw how the persons who identified as members of the LGBT community shifted and held their spaces in comparison to the straight cis people in the room. It was so fascinating to see how outside dynamics can still be brought into this ideal space that is supposed to be Seeds of Peace.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>How was your Seeds of Peace experience differ during your first year compared to your year as a PS?</strong>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            For my first year when I came back and I didn't have anybody else that had gone with me. It was such a struggle to try to describe where I had been for two weeks like the life changing experiences I had because, a lot of the time, people don't really understand what Seeds of Peace is. So, it was very hard to shift from a world where I could start talking about class consciousness with my neighbor or I can just look at my bunkmate and be like hey let's talk about systemic oppression and then come back to an environment where it is like "Oh, I'm not really into politics; it's very stressful."
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            I would say my first year was filled with a lot of self learning; I definitely learned how I operate within myself. I was able to kind of see myself, for once, as a leader and as somebody who held some form of importance. Before I went to camp, I would definitely describe myself as a total doormat and a total people pleaser. During those first two and a half weeks, I was really able to kind of figure out how I wanted to define Danielle. It was whether or not I wanted to share my energy with certain groups of people, and it was really based on a lot of internal reflection, and it was this really great time of personal/internal reflection and finding my inner peace.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            Then I went back in 2019 for my second year through the PS program. This time, I think it was about finding how I operate within the world. I was really able to see the way that my identity groups interact with not only the world but with the people who also occupy the world. When I'm occupying spaces, I can recognize how my energy fills a room. It was great to see that as a PS, how I'm supposed to shift paradigms, as in the name. I learned how my energy can do that and how I can make the active choice every day to do that.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            For my experience as a PS, I had this entire new level of confidence. I remember a different PS asked me "Why do you never talk?" and I responded with such confidence. I was like " I speak when I have something to say, I don't just fill the air anymore" and the shock on their face was incredible. I really learned how to operate within the world with Seeds of Peace.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>What were some realizations you had after Seeds of Peace?</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            I think one thing that comes with being  a Seeds of Peace alum in any fashion is being able to look around you and see how much you have been able to grow in terms of your classmates, oftentimes. What I mean by that is that I, as a senior, will watch as some of the peers in my class be the exact same people they were their freshman year, their sophomore year, their junior year, and because of my Seeds of Peace experiences, I really couldn't imagine not changing. Some people are still super complacent and comfortable in their complaisance - the type where they have the mindset of “if ain't broke don't fix it.” I just know that because of Seeds of Peace, I was able to adopt a mentality that "even if it ain't broke, let's see how we can fix it." It's really mind-blowing because you're able to see how you approach situations differently like while some of my friends are still getting caught in drama, I'm able to really move forward in my life and choose to exit situations if I don't like the energy of a group of people, I can leave now. I really attribute that to Seeds of Peace.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            I do wish Seeds of Peace placed a little more emphasis on how much introspective change you can do and how that is equally as powerful as going home and making outward change. I wish that Seeds was able to highlight people who simply make changes within themselves more often. Because when I came back the first time, I didn't do much - I literally just attempted to stay alive for my sophomore year and that was good enough for me. I watched my friends as they were going to protests or as they were building hospitals for infants and I felt isolating and sad that I couldn't do anything. I'm just alive - that's it. And I do wish people would highlight smaller acts of change because you can make change in a multitude of fashions as opposed to always being this tangible and outward means of change.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>How did you change as a person because of Seeds of Peace?<strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            I almost picture it like a Pokemon where it goes from its first evolution to the second, and so on. So many of my friends were just the same old and it was this feeling of "Wow, I now have to make a choice of whether or not I want to stay within this friendship or relationship, whether or not I want to stay with it and try to coach them on their learning growth and their journey towards their personal evolution, or if I want to leave. I think Seeds of Peace also did open up the possibility of leaving. To me, this is something that should be more normalized because I would always be the rehabilitation center for people, I would be the one who would bark out and say "oh my gosh, I can fix them" and Seeds of Peace was a great eye opener to this idea that I don't have to go around playing Doctor Danielle to try to fix people.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            If I were to use a word to describe Seeds of Peace, it is the idea of balance and understanding where you want to pour energy, where you want to take energy, where you want to anchor, where you want to leave like what spaces do you want to occupy in, how do you share your energy with others, etc. I think that balance is also what's missing from regular outside of Seed of Peace life. Because, in May, the amount of friends I saw that completely lost their balance because of the external change that happens outside of their control. Had I not had Seeds of Peace to instill in me this internal balance regulator, I would have also joined them and felt that unbalance.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>What are some norms and advice you have for having conversations with people of different backgrounds, perspectives, and ideologies?</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            What I learned from Tim Wilson, the director of Seeds of Peace, is that you set the table and then you eat it. Within that analogy, you picture yourself as you're ready to eat a really delicious dinner like you're not going to sit at a table that has termites in it, and wobbly chairs and then eat your five star dinner. You're not gonna want to do that - you're not gonna want to sit at that table, you're not gonna want to immerse yourself with anybody else at the table if you're too focused on the table shaking and cracking. More, would you want to have a table that's gorgeous marble, and then bring nothing but a piece of bread to the table. So with that in mind when you're having these diverse conversations you already know that what you're bringing to the table is present, you know that you're bringing diverse identities, really rich experiences, so you have that set. So the only thing that you should really be putting energy into is setting that table.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            And with that, your table is essentially the tone in the room when somebody sits down. When you're bringing all these diverse persons to the table, it has to be a warm, inviting tone. If I were to just pull you aside if we went to the same school in the middle of the hallway and be like "Do you want to talk about sexism?" you're gonna feel uncomfortable and when you know that people are watching— it can be even more uncomfortable. So, you want to foster spaces where you know that if you want to come and talk about sexism with me—I'm going to respect your opinion, I'm going to be kind to you, I'm going to call you out in a positive manner if I'm confused by what you say, and I'm also going to make space for what you're saying. So with that in mind, when you set the table, you have those norms, and you can either form them with the people you're talking with or already have them predisposed.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            But one thing I do regarding the ladder is, I always come to a space, knowing what norms I want to set for that space. I always bring space and make space with me because I know when I'm very passionate about something, I tend to talk a lot. I tend to almost cut people off, so I'm very mindful about how I'm taking space in a room and making space for others. I'm a very passionate person so I tend to react to things. If somebody says something and I'm like "Oop" then I'll make facial expressions or I'll give people the side eye.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            However, one thing I have learned is that I want to assume the best intentions for the people around me. I want to assume that they didn’t mean to come off that harsh or they might just say this not that, and it's always great to ask. Just setting those tones are extremely vital. Then, there is also checking in with people and seeing if there's anything they want to add because perhaps we're 30 minutes into the conversation and now somebody says, "Oh, can we add **speak up when you talk** to the group norms, I'm struggling to hear."  It is important to understand that group norms are fluid, but also they're concrete in the same sense because if somebody says, "Oh, I don't want **respect** to be a group norm." You cannot invite them into that space. You cannot hold that space for them. Understand that what you define as something vital to sitting at that table and eating this meal is one of the key steps to holding these good dialogues because it makes people feel comfortable.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>Why is it so hard for people to have conversations about tough issues, such as race, privilege, gender, sexuality, sexism, socio-economic issues etc?</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            I would say it's because we're very comfortable in complacency. We're a society where we like being comfortable, and once we achieve that sense of comfort, if anybody seeks to disrupt that comfort, we go on the defensive. Because in my dialogue group, we had three people who are a part of the 1% like very wealthy people. I remember whenever we would have conversations surrounding the topic of being a little lower middle class or lower class, they would be quick to defend themselves. It was so mind-blowing because we weren't saying anything about them and we weren't saying anything bad about them, but it was something where we were threatening their status quo—creating a world where there's more equality in socioeconomic status threatened the person because that is what they held comfortable to themselves.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            We have to acknowledge the privileges people have and the privileges they don't want to lose. Because when we're in these spaces and we're trying to have dialogues, we have to be so mindful about saying, "I am not you." Because the tone completely changes if I say "you as a white man are the one oppressing me," versus if I say it "some of these actions in society that I face because I am a black woman are oppressive..." completely changes the tone and saying, some of this actions in society that I face because I am a black woman are therefore harmful.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            The way that you hold those spaces and make sure that you're acknowledging that it's not a defensive space is super vital. Also, recognize that some people won't change. Some people go to Seeds of Peace and they come back the exact same person; other people have this a complete metanoia and they change. Understand that when we bring ourselves outside of Seeds of Peace, there will be people who join our conversations and they bring it back to their group chat and they say this was the stupidest thing I've ever done, there will be people who bring it back and they say I didn't learn anything from that. Sometimes, these people might be the majority, but, as long as you're doing the fundamentals of acknowledging the space you're in, acknowledging the identities present, and being mindful not to make those accusatory statements, you can get far with dialogues outside of Seeds of Peace and make them successful, but you cannot let anybody who doesn't come away with something positive bring down that space that you have tried so hard to create.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>Given the current climate of our country, we see many divides between different ideologies and perspectives. Why is dialogue more important than ever before?</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            I would say, first off that a society without dialogue has its own downfall. In May when things were really starting to erupt in terms of racial injustice, the pandemic, and all of the above, people were struggling to talk about anything. There was a lot of deafening silence from my friends and from people I looked up to - the staff and faculty at my school and I was shocked. I was itching at the seams, trying to speak up, trying to say things, and it felt like my voice was falling on deaf ears because I didn't have anybody to talk with.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            This idea of understanding dialogue is the Bridge to Terabithia; it is what connects you to the other side. I remember that I would see some of the people who attended my school posting these horribly big things on their Instagram story and here I would swipe up and ask them "Why?" and that "Why" was oftentimes met with "I don't know." The idea of dialogue and asking that "Why" is the catalyst to getting people to either change their opinion, or at least become a little more open minded, and that open mindedness is what we need to make any progress in terms of racial justice, socio economic justice, handling a pandemic, and everything in between.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            Dialogue is the route to opening minds and making change. What a lot of people don’t understand is that having tough conversations can also benefit you as an individual and it doesn't have to be with other people - it can be some self-reflection. If I had kept everything in my soul from May all the way to now, I would have exploded by now. Because I was able to have dialogue within myself —whether it would just be looking in the mirror and speaking to myself or chatting with my mom and dad. Just being able to have people who understand dialogue in the sense of carrying it out and saying "This is what I'm looking at; this is what's frustrating me; here's what's making me happy; here's what's making me sad." Having those tools, not only for your inner self, but for the way you operate in your communities is so important because while my friends were battling these online racists, I was able to pick my own time and say, "Okay, I'll choose to educate or maybe I won't respond to these people anymore." It just changes the way you see yourself in these situations of crisis when there's conflict knocking at the door. If I were to not know how to perform dialogue or just had to hold it within myself, I would crumble. However, because I had those tools, I'm able to face it head on and then try to make change in any way possible.
          </p>
          <p class="stories-q">
            <strong>How can we promote and hold spaces to have conversations within our own community, even when they are difficult?</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="stories-a">
            Believe it or not, when you simply just hold space for others, people will eventually trickle in. If you start, whether it be by yourself or with a small group of persons and start to have those small conversations then draw up a flyer, and put the word out. People might not stroll in the first day, nor the second, nor the 30th, but people will eventually seek out what's different from the status quo. I've been using a lot of analogies, but it's like if we as Mainers saw a brand new shop that brands itself as "California dreaming," we would all have that curiosity because it's different from our status quo - we're Mainers, so we're comfortable in Maine. But if we had something so different anchor a space that we could occupy, that's where lights go off in our head and the human reaction is "Hey I want to try that out."
          </p>
          <br>
          <p class="stories-a">
            So, with dialogue, even when they have to be these heavy spaces, as long as they're inviting and as long as those ground norms are set, people will eventually stroll in. Perhaps the first person who strolls in will come back next time with a friend, or two, or three next time they come. To sum that all up, it's essentially just creating those spaces and having them be available, and then making sure that they're warm, inviting and squeeze them into your everyday conversations. Your space is still as valid as other spaces that might have 100 members every time - it's about taking time to create these safe spaces in the first place.

            I would say one of the “do's” is create those spaces and lay down the ground rules to ensure that people understand that this is not a debate, this is not something where you are coming in with an argument, this is not something where you're going to come and attack the minority group that's present in the room. Then the major “don’t” is understanding that any other minority group in the room is not the spokesperson, they are not the people who you are supposed to turn to and ask "tell me about being black." They are not those types of people.

          <p class="stories-a">
            Once you establish those two major do's and don'ts, the space then becomes something where you ensure people that it's a conversation, it might get heated, but it's a conversation. You also want to ensure that you're recognizing that even within a homogeneous group, there is still diversity within that like not all the white people at my school are mega conservatives and not all the white people at my school are straight.

          <p class="stories-a">
            Understand that you should be asking that people come with a difference of opinion, so then it creates not only a kind of firewall for anybody who's a blatant minority, but it does create something where you're able to have more allies, and a sense of ally ship, because if I know that I can turn to "Tiffany" and know that "Tiffany" thinks that ‘Black Lives Matter’, I'll feel 10 times more comfortable than having this false us versus them dichotomy. I would say that holding dialogues with homogeneous spaces is to acknowledge the diversity within those spaces and within the majority group, and also acknowledging that this is not something where every minority group becomes a spokesperson.

            As cliche as it sounds, just keep at it. There will never be a perfect dialogue, there will always be somebody who might come away feeling hurt, stressed, upset, angry, or bored. Don't let that stop you. As a society that sees things based on tangible achievements like “you did good on the paper because you've got A” , dialogue is completely different. There's no A on your dialogue group, and being able to understand that you'll never know what goes on in some of these minds - the person walking out of the room might be thinking "Wow, that was the most boring thing I've ever been to" or they might be thinking "I feel so conscious. I feel so awake." and you'll never know. Sometimes they'll walk up and tell you, but just keep doing it for the sake of doing it. Even if your group has two people and it's just you and your friend going back and forth, that is just as valid as a group that has 500 people and understanding that no matter the size, no matter how long you have these dialogue for - that it is still worth it because at least it might be getting through to just one person, and if it's not, you and your friends are building up your consciousness about how you want to operate in the world, and these are life skills.

            There will be lots of time in life where you will have to disassemble a conflict, where you will have to calm down the nerves in your room, and just understand that sometimes we might be looking for short term tangible results. In reality, this is about the long term, and about who you are creating yourself to be: the mark and legacy that you're leaving on the world around you.
