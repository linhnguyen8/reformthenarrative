                  Take a break from Social Media
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  Anti-racism resources are all over social media. While the increase in education/allyship resources is great, it is important to not feel overwhelmed because of the movement. Take regular breaks from social media to refresh your mind. It is a privilege to be able to step away from your phone and avoid the conversations about racism, but too much screentime can be counterproductive and damaging.
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  Participate in mental health practices in order to rejuvenate yourself (go for a walk, listen to music, read a book, or meditate)
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  Save educational posts for later! In doing so, you will absorb the information when you have a fresh mind. This will allow you to let the information soak in properly & continue to care about the movement!
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Talk to a Trusted Friend/Social Circle
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  Turn to a safe-space like a close friend for voicing your feelings instead of social media. Finding private groups to talk about your emotions is important because bottling up your emotions can impact your mental health in the long run. Remember, it is okay to feel fatigued; you are not alone!
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Don't Feel Guilty
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  It is okay to take a break and relax! Pushing yourself to the point where you are exhausted is not healthy. Taking breaks is not losing the momentum as long as you can come back to the conversation and continue the fight against injustice. Long-term systemic change is the goal & we do not want to burn out!
                </p>
                <p class="card-text">
                  Reflect
                </p>
                <p class="card-link">
                  With our easy access to digital information, it can be easy to feel overwhelmed. However, it is important to reflect on these emotions and use it as a driving force for advocacy & allyship. Although there might be avoidance of emotions, it is healthy to face up to your emotions—be it anger, frustration, anxiety, or helplessness. Change takes time. When the movement has lost its publicity, we must continue the fight, whether through educating ourselves or our close ones, we must continue forward

                <p class="card-link">While the term ally and accomplice are difficult to distinguish, many social justice advocates see the site of focus as the main difference between the work of an ally and that of an accomplice. Clemens in 2017 writes, “An ally will mostly engage in activism by standing with an individual or group in a marginalized community. An accomplice will focus more on dismantling the structures that oppress that individual or group—and such work will be directed by the stakeholders in the marginalized group.” Many resources below use the term “allyship” since it has been popularized in multiple media platforms as a step towards anti-oppression work. Allyship is important because it pushes us to support marginalized groups on an individual level; however, in the realm of social change, we must focus on dismantling structures that allow for groups to be oppressed in the first place.</p>
