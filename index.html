Online petitions draw the media’s attention to a story and urge for action steps. They are a quick and easy way to raise awareness for issues and solutions. Still this is just the beginning. We must research, educate ourselves, and relearn.</p>

        <p>Reform the Narrative is a youth-based platform focused on centering BIPOC youth through writing, interviews, and educational resources. We seek to amplify the youth’s first hand experiences to combat prejudice and stereotypes that often impact marginalized communities. We stand against racism, bigotry, and prejudice through providing educational resources and action steps in order to foster accompliceship and accountability. Resources will be catered towards the status quo but Reform the Narrative is still a working document in hopes of dismantling oppression and will be adaptable to the times. Reform the Narrative is a place where you can speak your truth, raw, unfiltered, and free from corporate media biases. Let’s listen to each other, celebrate our differences, and lift one another up.</p>

        <h3 class="main-title">Why Storytelling?</h3>
        <p>While reading databases and articles help us recognize the systemic racism within our community, Story-telling contains a feature that these resources do not provide: empathy. We are taught about the racism surrounding our environment, yet we do not learn. The only way to have people exchange ideas and learn from each other is through storytelling. There are a few studies that prove when we engage with statistics first we actually tend to shut down the listener. When we engage with a narrative, people are more apt to engage and reflect. As a system that operates in all levels of our society, racism can be unpacked through stories that evoke understandings in ways that abstract analysis and rigid facts cannot do alone. Polarized mainstream media tends to perpetrate a narrative that categorizes marginalized groups within harmful stereotypes. That is why ‘Reform the Narrative’ prioritizes people’s actual voices and their storytelling. We seek to change the narrative and reform the status quo—one story at a time.

I do think that my high school is trying to be more inclusive over the past couple of years and trying to look at its programs, reforms, and policies through an equity lens."

There’s this mentality that it is family values versus mental health, but in reality, it goes hand in hand. It'll be an uphill battle, but I think it's a conversation that we need to have."

        <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Linh Nguyen (she/her/hers) and I am the founder of Reform the Narrative. My idea for this project sparked with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement. As I began to educate myself on anti-racism work, I felt like signing a few petitions, making some donations, and advocating on social media wasn’t enough. I had picked up some coding skills over the summer, so I wanted to use the knowledge I have gained to create an accessible platform that synthesizes anti-racism resources compiled from social media and other media outlets. The influx of allyship and anti-racism resources on social media can be intimidating, and if we don’t take a step back, burnout can happen, which can be a detriment to this movement. I hope this platform guides you to educate yourself on these issues and prompt you to take a proactive stance towards anti-racism/anti-oppression work. For me, education is not just about learning through books and articles but also through listening to the stories of others. I have had conversations with people from all walks of life and their stories told the unfiltered experiences that corporate news media often lacked. I aim to amplify those voices—allowing them to speak their truths. At such a heightened time, we can feel divided as a community; however, I hope that listening to these stories can spark empathy and encourage you to continue this fight for change. This is still a working document. These are the resources I have compiled over the past months, but I know they are not entirely representative of many communities who continually face discrimination and prejudice on the daily basis. I hope to generate more inclusivity within this site, which means branching out my resources toward more marginalized communities who have been overlooked.
